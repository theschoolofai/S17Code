"""The extracted workers must behave exactly like the closures they replaced.

Moving forty-eight closures out of a thousand-line function is mechanical, which
is precisely why it is dangerous: a worker that is subtly rewritten during the
move still passes every test that only checks the capability exists. During this
extraction `git_diff` was rewritten to shell out to `git diff` instead of using
the workspace's own diff, and the whole suite stayed green.
