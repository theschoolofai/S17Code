"""The judge is the load-bearing part of p1, so it is tested like one.

Cost per resolved task is only as trustworthy as the thing that says "resolved".
These tests pin the properties that make the verdict usable in a lecture:

* the rubric, the weights and the bar come from config, not from Python;
* an unparseable judge reply is a JUDGE failure and never a task outcome;
* an empty or errored answer is unresolved without paying for a judge call;
* a task file with invented criteria works, because the rubric is generic;
* panel disagreement is reported rather than smoothed away.

Nothing here talks to a network. The transport is a stub, which is the point: the
judge's contract is one ``chat(prompt=, system=, request=)`` call.
