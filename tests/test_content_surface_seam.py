"""Content that arrives as a list must still reach the surface.

A run produced ten exam questions as a JSON array. The object parser rejected
the array, `structured` came back null, and the questions went into `text` as a
serialised string. The harness exposed that string at `/summary`, the surface
bound to `/summary/0/question_text`, and a JSON pointer cannot index into a
string. Fifty-five components validated, rendered, and showed nothing.

Nothing in that chain reported an error, which is what makes it worth a test.
