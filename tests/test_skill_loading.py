"""Skills are requested, not matched: the planner reads a listing and asks by name.

The earlier design injected whole skill bodies whenever the run's opening prompt
happened to contain a keyword. A skill could therefore never fire because the
agent decided it needed one, which is the only reason to have skills at all.
These tests hold the three levels of disclosure apart: a listing that is always
carried, a body that arrives on request, and reference files that arrive only if
the body sends the agent to them.
