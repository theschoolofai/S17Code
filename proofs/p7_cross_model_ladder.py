"""p7 — the ladder routes across MODELS, and budget pressure walks it down.

The claim this proof exists to defend is the one a "model routing" session cannot
be allowed to fudge. A ladder whose rungs are the same model with different
reasoning budgets is a *throttle*, not a router: a downgrade under pressure buys
a cheaper call, but it never buys a different model, so nothing about model
selection has been demonstrated. Four claims, all read from live calls:

1. **Every rung is a different model.** Ask for each rung by name and the model
   that answers is that rung's configured model, and no two rungs answer with
   the same one.
2. **Pressure downgrades across models.** Ask for the TOP rung with a node
   allowance that only covers a lower rung, and the controller charges the lower
   rung — a different provider and a different model, not the same model asked
   to think less. Repeated for every rung below the top, so the walk down the
   whole ladder is shown, not just its first step.
3. **The rungs are monotone in price.** Projected worst-case cost rises with the
   ladder, which is the only thing that makes "one rung cheaper" meaningful.
4. **The measured spread is real.** The observed dollar cost of the same prompt
   at the top rung, divided by the bottom rung, reported as a multiple.

Nothing here names a provider, a model or a price. The rungs, their models, the
allowances that force each downgrade and the prompt all come from config and
from the command line, so pointing tiers.yaml at a different ladder changes the
numbers rather than breaking the proof.
