"""p1 — cost per CALL is a trap; cost per RESOLVED TASK is the number.

Three strategies, one task set, one ledger, one generic judge:

**A always-frontier** every task on the top rung of the configured ladder, once.
**B always-cheapest** every task on the bottom rung, *retried* on an unresolved
                      verdict per ``strategies.cheapest_retries`` in evals.yaml.
                      The retry loop is the whole point: without it this baseline
                      is a straw man, and with it it is the trap real agents fall
                      into.
**C budget-aware**    starts on the rung the ladder's ``role_tiers`` declares and
                      climbs one rung on an unresolved verdict, every call still
                      admitted, metered and possibly downgraded by the S17Code
                      hard controller.

Every strategy runs through :class:`~s17code.economics.BudgetedGateway`, so all
three numbers come out of the same ledger, priced by ``pricing.yaml`` from the
token counts the gateway actually reported. Nothing here knows a provider, a
model, a tier name or a price: the ladder is read from config at run time, so the
proof survives the ladder being rewritten under it.

**"Resolved" is decided by a generic rubric, never an answer key.** See
:mod:`s17code.evals`. The task set is a data file; swap it for your own:

    python proofs/p1_cost_per_task.py --tasks proofs/tasks/mixed.jsonl \\
        --principal proofs/s15/p1 --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8112
    python proofs/p1_cost_per_task.py --tasks /path/to/yours.jsonl --offline

**On what this proof asserts.** The checks that gate its exit code are the
invariants that must hold whatever the data says: every task was attempted and
judged, no provider call escaped the meter, no answer was graded by its own model,
no verdict was unparseable, and an empty answer never counted as resolved. Whether
B actually shows the signature failure mode — a *lower* cost per call and a
*higher* cost per resolved task — is a FINDING, reported either way with the
numbers behind it. Gating the exit code on it would be an invitation to tune the
task set until the story came out right.
