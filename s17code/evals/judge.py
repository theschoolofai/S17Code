"""LLM-as-judge against a GENERIC rubric: did this answer resolve this task?

The one number the session turns on — cost per *resolved* task — needs a verdict,
and the cheap way to get one is a per-task answer key. That is exactly what this
module refuses to do. The rubric is fixed, task-agnostic and config-owned; the
only per-task input is a short ``expectation`` string carried in the task data
file. Point the same judge at a task set nobody has seen and it works unchanged.

Four properties make the verdict something a lecture can lean on:

**Independence.** The judge is a panel of gateway requests declared in
``evals.yaml``, so it can be pointed at models the answering ladder never uses.
Every verdict records which provider and model judged it and flags
:attr:`Verdict.self_judged` when a judge graded its own model's output. The flag
is not enforcement — self-judging is sometimes unavoidable — it is disclosure.

**Disagreement is reported, not hidden.** With more than one panel member the
verdict carries the agreement fraction and a ``disputed`` flag, and the
configured tie-break decides split panels.

**An unparseable verdict is a JUDGE failure, never a task outcome.** A judge that
returns prose, truncates, or omits a criterion produces
``status="judge_failed"`` and ``resolved=None``. Nothing silently becomes
resolved or unresolved, because both directions would quietly bias the headline
number: counting a judge failure as unresolved inflates the cost per resolved
task, counting it as resolved deflates it.

**An empty or errored answer is unresolved without a call.** There is nothing to
grade, and paying a judge to confirm that would be theatre.
