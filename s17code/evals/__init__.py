"""Did the answer RESOLVE the task? A generic rubric, never a per-task answer key.

Cost-per-*call* is arithmetic. Cost-per-*resolved-task* needs somebody to say
whether a task was resolved, and that is the reason this proof was deferred: the
obvious way to decide it is to write down the right answer for each task, which
bakes a use case into the library and measures nothing a reviewer could reuse.

So the judgement is split in two:

* the **rubric** is fixed, generic and config-owned (:mod:`s17code.evals.config`).
  Every criterion is a property of an answer-to-a-task pair — did it address what
  was asked, is it specific, is it self-consistent, is it complete enough to act
  on — and holds for a task nobody has seen.
* the **task** is data (:mod:`s17code.evals.tasks`). A task file may carry a short
  natural-language ``expectation``; the judge scores against whatever text the
  file supplies and never against anything compiled into Python.

:mod:`s17code.evals.judge` runs that rubric through the same gateway contract the
runtime uses, on a panel of models named in config, and reports what it could not
parse instead of guessing.
