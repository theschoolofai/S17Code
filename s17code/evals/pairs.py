"""Labelled prompt pairs, and the threshold arithmetic they support.

A semantic cache is a classifier. It is handed two prompts and it decides, from
one number, whether they want the same answer. Every classifier has an operating
point, and the operating point of a semantic cache is its similarity threshold —
so the only honest way to choose one is the way any operating point is chosen:
label some pairs by hand, score them with the real scorer, and sweep.

This module owns the two halves of that and nothing else:

* :func:`load_pairs` reads the labelled set. The pairs are DATA, in a file the
  reviewer owns, for the same reason the task set in :mod:`s17code.evals.tasks`
  is: a set of "these two mean the same thing" judgements compiled into Python
  is a use case welded into a library, and it measures nothing anyone else can
  reuse.
* :func:`sweep` turns scores plus labels into a true-positive and
  false-positive rate at each candidate threshold. It knows nothing about
  embeddings, cosine, caches or gateways — it takes floats and booleans — so the
  same function grades any scorer you point at the same file.

The asymmetry between the two error kinds is the whole reason this exists. A
false negative costs one provider call. A false positive returns a stored answer
to a question nobody asked, with no signal that anything went wrong.
