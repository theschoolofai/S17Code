"""Map graph journal events onto AG-UI events.

The Session 13 graph already records a durable, ordered journal. AG-UI is
CopilotKit's event-based agent-UI protocol. We do not invent a stream; we
translate the one that exists into AG-UI's vocabulary so a browser can render
it. The S13 event shape is ``{sequence, kind, node_id, payload}``.

AG-UI event names use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE. We use the handful the surface
needs and leave the rest of the ~30-event protocol available:

  run_started    -> RUN_STARTED
  graph_patched  -> STATE_DELTA          (the graph structure changed)
  task_started   -> STEP_STARTED
  task_succeeded -> STEP_FINISHED (+ STATE_DELTA with the node result)
  task_failed    -> STEP_FINISHED (error) + RUN_ERROR
  task_cancelled -> CUSTOM (step_cancelled)
  run_resumed    -> CUSTOM (run_resumed)

RUN_FINISHED is not a journal event in S13 (finished is a run flag), so it is
derived from the snapshot after the last event rather than invented. That is
the honest mapping: we emit exactly what the graph recorded plus one derived
terminal event.

STATE_SNAPSHOT vs STATE_DELTA
-----------------------------
AG-UI draws a sharp line between the two. A ``STATE_DELTA`` carries one
incremental change; a client stays whole only by folding every delta in order
from the run's start. A ``STATE_SNAPSHOT`` carries the COMPLETE current state,
so a client that dropped its connection can rebuild in a single message instead
of replaying the whole tape. Here the "state" is the run's own data model: the
``/results/<node>`` map the task_succeeded deltas write, plus the graph patches.
``replay_state`` is the reducer that folds a stream into that model;
``run_data_model`` is the same fold over a whole run; ``state_snapshot`` wraps a
complete data model as the single event a reconnecting client needs.
