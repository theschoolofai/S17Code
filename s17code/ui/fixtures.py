"""Recorded graph journals for replay.

The live UI reads the runtime's graph in-process (see routes.py). Offline, or in
tests and widget replays, it reads a recorded journal fixture captured from a
real S13 run. The recorded shape is byte-for-byte the S13
``GET /v1/agent/runs/{id}`` response: ``{run_id, finished, nodes, edges,
events}``.

The UI holds no provider credential and never talks to the gateway. It only
reads the graph the agent already produced.
