"""Bounds on unattended operation, enforced outside the agent.

Session 15 gave every *run* a hard ceiling and refused before the provider was
contacted. That ceiling stops being a ceiling the moment the agent starts its own
runs, because nothing stops it starting more of them. An agent woken by a stream
of events needs a bound over a **window**, not over one request.

Three separate things get bounded here, and they fail for different reasons:

* **Being awake.** The relevance gate is a model call on every matching event,
  forever, whether or not any work follows. It is usually the larger bill and it
  is the one nobody budgets, because it does not look like work.
* **Doing.** Runs per window and spend per window, per subscription.
* **Being used as a weapon.** Anyone who can create an event can schedule this
  agent. A per-source arrival limit turns "flood the webhook" from a spending
  attack into a recorded refusal.

And one thing gets refused outright: an event this agent itself caused. An agent
that acts in a system it also watches will see its own action arrive as a new
event. Without an actor check that is a self-sustaining loop, and a spend ceiling
only ends it after the money is gone.

Every refusal is *recorded*. Session 15 learned this the hard way: a control that
prevents work leaves no trace of the work it prevented, so an operator reading the
dashboard sees a quiet night and an untouched budget either way.
